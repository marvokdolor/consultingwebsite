									<h2>Projects</h2>
									<h3><a target='_blank' href='http://www.greatlakes-seaway.com/en/environment/ballast_collaborative.html'>Great Lakes Ballast Water Collaborative</a></h3>
									<h4>(U.S. Department of Transportation, Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation)</h4>
									<p>I provide multi-faceted support for the Collaborative. This includes agenda development: a months long exercise building consensus among a range of experts from different industries, culminating in a comprehensive agenda for multi-day meetings. I also coordinate meeting logistics and supervise administrative staff in completing this function - working with venues in a variety of U.S. and Canadian locations to host a meeting for 70+ people.
During the meetings I adjust the agenda on the fly to facilitate longer conversations on topics that are particularly resonant with attendees.
<br/>After meetings I serve as managing editor for the group's <a target='_blank' href='http://www.greatlakes-seaway.com/en/environment/ballast_collaborative.html'>reports</a>, which have been cited by the EPA's Science Advisory Board.
<br/>In the months between meetings I stay in touch with key attendees: via attendance at other meetings, emails with pertinent and useful information to their work, and informal catchups whenever possible. </p>
<h3><a target='_blank' href='http://www.glos.us'>Great Lakes Observing System</a></h3>
<p>I initiate and facilitate conversations between GLOS and senior leadership of other organizations. I guide these conversations towards synergistic collaborative endeavors.
I advise GLOS senior leadership on organizational management issues including staff motivation and  accountability and enabling more active board participation.
<br/>I developed, iterated and implemented a GLOS Awareness-Raising campaign to develop relationships with congressional staff on behalf of GLOS. We went from staffers barely recognizing our organization's name to them reaching out to us and offering to bring the congressional members themselves to GLOS offices for in-person visits 6 months after the campaign began.
<br/>GLOS needed help with fundraising so I rolled up my sleeves and got to work exploring a range of options from large to tiny foundations, to government funding opportunities in both the U.S. and Canada. I lead or support proposal development to pursue these opportunities. </p>
									<h3><a target='_blank' href='http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/collections/2014/11/port-state-measures'>Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA) Campaign </a></h3>
									<h4>(The Pew Charitable Trusts, Ending Illegal Fishing Project)</h4>
									<p>Starting with the board-approved strategy document that described campaign goals, I developed detailed work plans for project consultants and staff. This included specific tasks, expected next steps, and deadlines. Tackling a problem like ending illegal fishing can be overwhelming and can lead to team members spinning their wheels as they face one seemingly intractable international negotiation process after the other. These plans provided a structure through which the team was able to achieve tangible, positive, project momentum and also helped us identify certain tasks that needed to be modified drastically. As part of this work, I developed advocacy material leading to U.S. implementation of the <a target='_blank' href='http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/analysis/2016/03/01/us-is-now-officially-a-party-to-port-state-measures-agreement'>PSMA</a>.
<br/>I also coordinated input to federal regulations from a number of other advocacy teams and edited this material down to concise prose. </p>
